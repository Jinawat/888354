		<p id="data">
			The way we deal with our health is undergoing a major transformation, 
			not only because mobile Internet technology has made it possible to have 
			continuous access to personal health information, but also because breaking 
			the trend of ever-growing healthcare costs is increasingly necessary. Estimates 
			indicate that more than 70 percent of the world population will have a smartphone 
			by 2017. Connectivity, interoperability, sensing, and instant feedback through smartphones 
			all provide new opportunities for gaining insights into our health behavior. Such insights are 
			improving, and understanding what motivates people to make healthy changes throughout their lifetimes 
			is becoming more important. Internet technology not only lets us continuously monitor an individual's physiological 
			and psychological state, but also allows for building up a lifelong record of physical, mental, and social health.
